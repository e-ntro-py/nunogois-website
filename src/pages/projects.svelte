      grid layout.`

			name: 'Custom JavaScript Framework (jQuery abstraction)',
			description: `Created a custom JavaScript framework based / on top of jQuery to use along with the previous options. This added 
      infinite possibilities, along with customization and integration options. This framework was meant as a very easy-to-use 
      programming language for our own and also end-users with the right permissions, where most of what was needed could be accomplished using 
      its simple functions. The framework went through several iterations, and this also included maintaining its documentation accordingly.`

			name: 'Custom JavaScript Framework (Server-side / Scheduling)',

			name: 'Legacy Custom File Format PDF Extraction',
			description: `Created a PDF extractor from a custom file format of a legacy app that was no longer maintained. It aggregated several files,

      using the so-called "magic numbers" to identify when PDFs started and ended.`

		{
			name: 'Data Matrix Code Scanner (Python Script)',
			description: `Created a data matrix code scanner script in Python. The codes were scanned from a very large volume of TIFF files, so it had
      to be extremely optimized. Besides managing the local files, it involved counting the percentage of yellow on the image (based on a configurable RGB range), 
      so that a correct amount of codes to be scanned could be calculated, in order to speed up the process significantly. Learned and used tools like 
      numpy, CV2, Wand, and more. It also involved querying data from a MySQL database and integrating everything with web-based APIs.`
