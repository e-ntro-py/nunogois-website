				I love coding, it's super fun and gratifying. As an INTJ, I am focused, rational, introvert
				and a bit of a loner. I'm a better listener than talker. I am a college dropout and
				self-taught. I have Crohn's so I have a limited diet and don't drink or smoke. I try my best
				to stay healthy.<br />I love videogames, tech, music, movies, TV series, reading, writing,
				running, hiking and many other things.<br />
				Feel free to ask me anything!

		What makes me unique is my creativity and adaptability. More than a developer, I like to think
		of myself as an inventor and creator. I love tackling unique challenges, thinking of solutions
		and coming up with ideas. I'm generally at my best when I'm in a smaller-sized team, free to
		learn and think, and working on a challenging and fun project that I'm passionate about.
