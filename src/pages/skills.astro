            You'll find me constantly looking for new technologies to learn,
            explore and experiment with. One of the best parts of the tech
            landscape is that it's changing all the time, so it never gets boring.

            As a Full Stack Developer, I constantly seek out new technologies and
            techniques to learn and explore. I have experience in both front-end
            and back-end development, and I am always adapting and adding to my
            knowledge. Thanks to my experience, I am able to quickly adapt to new
            technologies and frameworks. It's generally easy for me to join a new
            project and learn the stack being used in a short amount of time, so
            only looking at the technologies I used in the past may prove somewhat
            limiting.
            <br /><br />
            Below are some of the technologies I've worked with or interacted
            with in the past.
