        Hello World!
      </p>
      <p class='my-5 text-left'>
        My name is Nuno GÃ³is. I am a creative and driven {years(DATE.BIRTHDAY)} year old
        Full Stack Developer from Portugal, with over {years(DATE.PROFESSIONAL)}
        years of professional
        <a href='#experience'>experience</a>. Passionate for the job, love putting
        skills to the test, facing challenges in a creative and perfectionist way.
        Experienced with every step of developing and delivering cross-platform,
        modern and responsive software, providing end-users the best experience I
        can. Worked with several different
        <a href='#skills'>technologies</a> across the stack, always willing to
        learn more and improve skills. I excel at taking a focused, creative,
        out-of-the-box approach to challenges, leveraging my adaptability,
        hard-working nature, and quick-learning abilities to deliver striking
        results.

            I love coding, it's super fun and gratifying. I am focused, rational,
            introspective and a bit of a loner. I'm a better listener than talker.
            I am a college dropout and self-taught. I have a preference for
            hands-on learning and enjoy applying my knowledge to real-world
            situations. I have Crohn's so I have a limited diet and don't drink or
            smoke. I try my best to stay healthy.<br />I love videogames, tech,
            music, movies, TV series, reading, writing, running, hiking and many
            other things.<br />
            <br />
            Feel free to ask me anything!

        My passion for technology and providing innovative quality experiences has
        driven me to become a versatile and creative Full Stack Developer. What
        makes me stand out is my creativity and adaptability. More than a
        developer, I like to think of myself as an inventor and creator. Focused
        on discovery and experimentation, I feel right at home on quick spikes and
        hackathons. I love tackling unique challenges, thinking of solutions and
        coming up with ideas. I usually thrive in a dynamic, smaller-sized
        collaborative environment where I can learn and innovate while working on
        challenging, passion-driven projects.
