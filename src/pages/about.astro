      <span class='font-bold'>Hello World!</span><br /><br />My name is Nuno
      GÃ³is. I am a creative and driven {years(DATE.BIRTHDAY)} year old
      Full-Stack Developer from Portugal, with over {years(DATE.PROFESSIONAL)}
       years of professional
      <a href='#experience'>experience</a>. Passionate for the job, love putting

      Experienced with every step of developing and delivering cross-platform,
      modern and responsive software, providing end-users the best experience I
      can. Worked with several different
      <a href='#skills'>technologies</a> across the stack, always willing to
      learn more and improve skills. I excel at taking a focused, creative,
      out-of-the-box approach to challenges, leveraging my adaptability,

          I love coding, it's super fun and gratifying. I am focused, rational,
          introspective and a bit of a loner. I'm a better listener than talker.
          I am a college dropout and self-taught. I have a preference for
          hands-on learning and enjoy applying my knowledge to real-world
          situations. I have Crohn's so I have a limited diet and don't drink or
          smoke. I try my best to stay healthy.<br />I love videogames, tech,
          music, movies, TV series, reading, writing, running, hiking and many
          other things.<br />
          <br />
           Feel free to ask me anything!

      My passion for technology and providing innovative quality experiences has
      driven me to become a versatile and creative Full-Stack Developer. What
      makes me stand out is my creativity and adaptability. More than a
      developer, I like to think of myself as an inventor and creator. Focused
      on discovery and experimentation, I feel right at home on quick spikes and
      hackathons. I love tackling unique challenges, thinking of solutions and
      coming up with ideas. I usually thrive in a dynamic, smaller-sized
      collaborative environment where I can learn and innovate while working on
      challenging, passion-driven projects.
